## Airplane Seat Assignment

This is a program that is used to assign seats for a commercial airplane. The airplane has 13 rows, with 6 seats in each row. Rows 1 and 2 are first class, rows 3 to 7 are business class, and rows 8 to 13 are economy class. This program prompts the user to enter the following information:

a.) Ticket type (first class, business class, or economy class)
b.) Desired Seat.

* Indicates that the seat is available; X indicated that the seat has been assigned. This is a menu-driven program and shows the user's choices and allows them to make the appropriate choices.

The menu allows the user to initialize all seats as vacant or generate a new set with partially occupied seats. When generating a set of partially occupied seats, these seats should be randomly generated. Idiot proofing is considered in this program (ex. an economy class ticket cannot be assigned to a first class seat).
